This project's main objective is to create a smart crop prediction system that uses machine learning algorithms to help farmers choose which crop is best to grow on their property.
By bridging the gap between conventional farming methods and contemporary data-driven decision-making, the system seeks to increase agricultural output while lowering losses.
